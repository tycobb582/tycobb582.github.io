				<h2>Project Description</h2>
				<p>
					TPPP is a game that I worked on alongside nine others for Global Game Jam 2023. The bulk of the 
					game was completed in the three days allotted for the jam with some polishing touches being added afterward. 
					It is a collection of minigames all based around the jam theme of "Roots". I primarily worked as one of two
					programmers on the "Spudacus" minigame, which tasks the player with reacting quickly to defend against incoming
					projectiles. After completing work on the minigame, I moved on to developing the systems needed to tie all of our
					minigames together and helped to bug fix throughout the project.
				</p>

				<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Successfully pitched and implemented the Spudacus minigame.</li>
					<li>Collaborated with our artist to design the environment and assets for the Spudacus minigame.</li>
					<li>Built the overarching game manager system which 
						switched music tracks and tracked completion.</li>
					<li>Designed and implemented functionality for the game's UI.</li>
					<li>Programmed a system to randomize the order in which levels are played.</li>
					<li>Helped to resolve merge conflicts and bug fix across the project.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Objectives and Implementation</h2>
				<p>
					With seven team members who wanted to be dedicated programmers on the project, we quickly settled on the
					minigame collection idea because it would allow us to splinter off into teams of 1-2 and give everyone
					on the project something that they could meaningfully contribute. With two members dedicated to artwork and 
					one musician working on the project as well, our main goal was to end up with a polished project that contained
					a minimum of three playable minigames. My own goals were to contribute as well as I could, and to get more experience
					developing alongside artists. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I began the project working on the Spudacus minigame, which has the player switching between two different shields
					in order to block against the two types of projectiles coming at them. It was inspired by a similar minigame that our
					team saw when we did research on the minigame collection Ape Academy, but I added the spin of having to swap between different
					shields. My partner on the minigame programmed the projectiles and their spawners, while I took on the player and UI elements.
					Starting out, we didn't have the assets for the differnt shield types, so I swapped materials on a primitive cube in order to
					test the mechanic. Then, when the assets were added to the project, I adjusted the code to switch the active flag on the two
					meshes.
				</p>

				</div>
				<p>
					The code reads the value of the ShieldSwap input event, and checks if there is a shield change already in progress. Then, it executes
					the code to swap the shields and changes the curShield variable so that the projectiles can see which shield they're hitting. I decided
					to use an enum for the different shield types to make the code more readable for myself and others on the project. After the swap, the ShieldChange
					boolean is set back to true to indicate that the process is done. This prevents the player from being able to hold the swap button down and
					change shields repeatedbly without needing to press the button again.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once Spudacus was essentially completed, I moved on to working on the game's main state controller that would handle our continuous gameplay
					mode (as opposed to our level select mode). Our idea was that after a player beat a minigame in this mode, they would return to a screen that
					would gradually show a tree and its roots growing over time depending on how many games they beat. The player would have to play through all
					of the minigames in a randomized order, and at multiple difficulty levels. To achieve this, I created a set list which stored the name of each minigame
					three times (for the three difficulties), then shuffled that list based on an implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. I decided to store
					all of the game names as strings rather than create an enum so that I could plug in an element from the set list when it came time to load the minigame scene.
				</p>
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Without a doubt, this was the best game jam I have participated in to date. I had fun hanging out and getting to know everyone on the team, and all of
					us were able to deliver on our chosen minigames. I also very much enjoyed the opportunity to work with one of our artists on the Spudacus level as 
					we planned out what assets we needed and how the scene would look. It was an incredibly positive experience overall, and I was able to get more valuable experience
					developing with a team, bug fixing, and sorting out merge conflicts. 			
				</p>
				<p>
					If there's one thing I would do differently, it would be to jump on creating
					and testing some functionality for our main game mode first before building out the minigames. It wouldn't have been as fun as working on Spudacus, but I think from a project management
					standpoint it would have been wiser to have had someone on that job before the latter half of the development time. Most of the code for the main mode I reworked and added
					in the days since the jam. Also, our whole team had to learn the hard way about the need to create builds of the project as early as possible. We started getting around to that 
					at about an hour before submission time, and all sorts of problems suddenly started to rise up from that, so a lot of panic could have been avoided if we started sooner.
					In addition, while working on that main mode I had to contend with the problem of things working within the editor, but breaking when tested in the build. Through that
					bug fixing process I've learned to avoid certain methods of trying to reference objects in the scene, and how to deal with objects that need to persist
					across multiple scene loads.
