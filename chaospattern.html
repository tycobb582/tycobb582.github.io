			<h2>Project Description</h2>
			<p>
				Veridian Forge's first project, Choas Pattern, was a cooperative multiplayer game that
				attempted to blend elements of action and strategy gameplay. I joined the project mid-production, 
				and in my time working on the game, I managed to complete tasks related to a variety of 
				mechanics and systems. Unfortunately, production on this project has been put on hold,
				but I'm incredibly proud of the work that I accomplished and thankful for the opportunity that I
				was given to learn and have high impact on development.
			</p>
