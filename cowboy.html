                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            Cowboy Defense Force is a multiplayer FPS built in Unreal Engine 5. It was created
                            by a team of five programmers for the 2023 Epic MegaJam with the theme of "antiquated future". 
                            The game was designed to play similarly to Call of Duty's Zombies gamemode, with the twist of 
                            taking place in a cyberpunk + western fusion setting. The player takes on the role of a cowboy 
                            defending their land from robots sent to seize it. They can equip themselves with up to four revolvers 
                            of various kinds, which automatically reload when stored in their mechanical holsters. Dealing 
                            damage and farming crops earns the player cash which can be used to purchase new weapons.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            My goal for this project was to become more adept at using Unreal Engine's network replication
                            features to build online games. I was also interested in working with FPS gameplay, as it was a
                            genre that I had yet to develop for. Our team had one week to complete this project, which for us 
                            meant the weekend and evenings during the week. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The biggest challenge that I faced during this project was training the rest of the team
                            to consider what they need to do to get their systems working in multiplayer. On the first
                            day of work on the project, I began by taking time to explain Unreal replication 
                            and RPCs to the group members that were able to be present. This proved to be very helpful;
                            though they didn't totally understand how everything worked, the quick crash course was enough
                            to enable the team to get started with prepping things for multiplayer. With each problem that
                            we worked through during development, their understanding grew, and I believe that if we were to work on another
                            multiplayer game in the future, we would be able to burn through tasks much quicker.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top:2%">
                            One of my favorite parts of working on this project was building the farming system. Our level
                            designer came up with the idea, and I took it upon myself to get it implemented because I believed
                            it fit well with our game's theming and helped to differentiate the concept more from its inspiration.
                            For our farming system, I made a crop spot object where crops can be grown. When the player interacts
                            with them, they plant a seed which automatically grows. The crop object has three stages of growth, with the last two
                            having two possible meshes that could display. Rather than use hard references for each of the possible
                            meshes, I opted for soft references that could be loaded asynchronously when needed. 
                        </p>
                        <div class="align-center">
                            <iframe class="bpcode" src="https://blueprintue.com/render/jjo6vd7s/" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>
                        <p style="padding-top:2%">
                        <p>
                            When the crop reaches its final stage, it acquires a tag which permits players to interact with the object,
                            harvesting the crop and adding to the player's cash. I created the interact event as part of a Blueprint
                            Interface, which allows for easy and quick implementation of new interactible objects.
                        </p>

                        <p style="padding-top:2%">
                        <p>
                            My work on this project also involved a fair amount of C++ coding, such as with the Grenade object I created.
                            For the grenade's movement, I was able to use Unreal's built-in Projectile Movement Component to quickly
                            establish the speed and bounciness of the explosives. For the actual exploding of the thing though, I had
                            to take matters into my own hands. The code above shows how the grenade calculates damage. The final value is scaled
                            based on distance from the hit actor, thus making it so that actors on the edge of the explosion are less
                            affected compared to those caught in the center of the blast.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the end, I feel happy with what I was able to accomplish for this project. I was able to make an impact on
                            a wide variety of features: I built the player HUD, implemented the revive mechanic, worked with the weapon system,
                            and created the farming system, all on top of being the head networking programmer. During this project, one important
                            thing that I learned was how to add sockets to skeletal mesh objects. While the other weapons in our game used hitscan,
                            the grenades I created were tangible projectiles. This meant that I had to find some way to make it look like they were
                            naturally shooting from the player's gun, and I was able to do that by adding custom sockets to the player's mesh.
                            I haven't done much work with fitting different visual elements together in UE, and I think the knowledge of how
                            to use this feature will come in handy if I need to work with meshes more in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, thanks to the MegaJam site, my team and I were able to become more familiar with all of the resources available
                            to developers working in UE. Quixel especially proved to be a fantastic resource for high quality assets that we will
                            certainly consider when developing any future jams. As an engineer-heavy team, tools like this are essential for
                            creating a quality product.
