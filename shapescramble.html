                                <p>Shape Scramble is a 2D shooter game programmed in python that implements
                                    math concepts involving vectors and matrices. The objective of the game
                                    is to survive for as long as possible while enemy shapes chase you. You gain
                                    points by shooting enemies and collecting triangles, and lose points when
                                    you collect red traingles, enemies collide with you, or your shots hit the boundaries.
                                    This is a class project, and the concept is not original.

									My primary goal for this project was to build the program according to the specs of
                                    the assignment, but also, I wanted to find out if I could increase the accuracy of
                                    collision between shots and enemies. While programming the assignment, I struggled with
                                    the idea of how to determine collision between the player's shot and polygons with sides
                                    greater than four. This was not a problem that was solved in class, and using the approximations
                                    that I had learned resulted in what I felt was janky gameplay. I spent most
                                    of my time with this project on developing an algorithm to remedy this.

									First, the game would detect collision between the shot and an axially-aligned bounding box.
                                    If the colliding shape was a square, the collision would immediately return true. If the colliding
                                    shape is a triangle, the code jumps to the further step of calculating circle-triangle collision.
                                    If the colliding shape is any other polygon, the program calls the more intensive circle-polygon
                                    collision function to determine whether a collision occured.

								<p style="padding-top:2%">
									This code applies the same methods used to determine collision between a circle and a triangle,
                                    but for an entire polygon. The function determines the total area covered
                                    by triangles that span from the circle's center to each point in the shape, then subtracts the area
                                    of the circle's sector that was counted in this calculation. If a collsion occurs, this should result
                                    in the total area calculated being less than or equal to the actual area of the shape.

                                    While it seems like this solution may not be perfect in practice, it did result
                                    in significantly improved collision detection. Working on this project taught me
                                    how useful documentation can be. I would come back to the above function many times and
                                    forget exactly how it worked, causing confusion and costing me time. Eventually, I
                                    added in the comments you see that help to walk through the logic, which made it much
                                    easier to come back to working on the project after breaks. Working on this project also
                                    reiterated to me how passionate I am about both problem solving and game development. I greatly
                                    enjoyed working through the solution to my issue and I also had fun with the whole project,
                                    creating custom sound effects and implementing the specified mechanics in my own interpretation.
