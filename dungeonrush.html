                                <p>Dungeon Rush is a turn-based RPG x endless runner game that I built in Python
									alongside one other teammate. I designed and pitched the original concept, and
									programmed the combat engine and runner-mode abilities. In the game,
									players control a party of three characters (a warrior, archer, and wizard).
									The main gamemode is an auto-runner game in which the player must avoid obstacles
									and reach the end goal within the time limit. If the player collides with an
									enemy, they must defeat a party of enemies within a turn-based battle system. They
									must make decisions quickly to save as much time as possible. Each character and
									enemy has unique stats and abilities, and in the runner mode, each playable character
									has unique abilities that help the player to avoid obstacles.

								<p>
									My goal with this project was to design a unique concept that would give me experience
									programming several different game mechanics and make for fun and interesting
									gameplay. I also worked to apply many of the object-oriented programming technziques 
									that I had learned over the course of my freshman year. The three main object types (player, 
									enemy, obstacle) inherited from base classes which made it easy to build content
									into the game.

									For example, all collision between players and enemies is handled by the base enemy class,
									and all of the debuffs we implemented are handled by the base class as well.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another aspect of the game that I played a large role in programming was the level manager.
									In order to make it easy to add new levels to the game, I created a level dictionary
									which would store all of the informtation that the game loop needed in order to
									run a new level, which made it simple to balance and modify different sections of
									the game.

									Left to right, the data included the player's speed, time range between enemy spawns,
									list of potential enemy spawns, the leve's boss, the amount of distance from the
									player's starting location to the boss, and the level's timer. These were all of the 
									variable that we wanted to modify between levels, and storing them in this way allowed us
									to both add and scale the difficulty of levels on the fly. 
								</p>

                                <p>Looking back on my code, there are certainly many improvements that could be made.
									For instance, while the code for drawing enemies could easily have been implemented in
									the base enemy class, I ended up creating separate functions for each enemy type.
									Despite the naive implementation of many things, I am quite proud of how this project
									turned out. I was able to design a concept, create a realistic development timeline, and execute
									on it. I also gained valuable experience on how to collaborate with other programmers and
									utilize version control software, and I learned firsthand how essential it is to
									pre-plan the overarching systems that need to be programmed into the game.
