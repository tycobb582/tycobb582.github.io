					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<p>
						Dungeon Rush is a turn-based RPG x endless runner game that I built in Python
						alongside one other teammate. I designed and pitched the original concept, and
						I programmed the combat engine as well as the runner-mode abilities. In the game,
						players control a party of three characters (a warrior, archer, and wizard).
						The main gamemode is an auto-runner game in which the player must avoid obstacles
						and reach the end goal within the time limit. If the player collides with an
						enemy, they must defeat a party of enemies within a turn-based battle system. They
						must make decisions quickly to save as much time as possible. Each character and
						enemy has unique stats and abilities, and in the runner mode, each playable character
						has unique abilities that help the player to avoid obstacles.
					</p>

					<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Designed and successfully pitched the project.</li>
						<li>Created and adhered to a production plan that resulted in implementation of all MVP features.</li> 
						<li>Programmed a versatile RPG combat system.</li>
						<li>Made animated sprites for the playable characters.</li>
						<li>Built a dictionary data structure that allowed for quick editing and addition of levels.</li>
						<li>Designed and implemented functionality for the game's UI.</li>
						<li>My first game completed as part of a team.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Objectives and Implementation</h2>
					<p>
						My goal with this project was to design a unique concept that would give me experience
						programming several different game mechanics and make for fun and interesting
						gameplay. I also worked to apply many of the object-oriented programming technziques 
						that I had learned over the course of my freshman year. The three main object types (player, 
						enemy, obstacle) inherited from base classes which made it easy to build content
						into the game.

					</div>
					<p style="padding-top:2%">
						For example, all collision between player and enemies is handled by the base enemy class,
						and all of the debuffs we implemented are handled by the base class as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another aspect of the game that I played a large role in programming was the level manager.
						In order to make it easy to add new levels to the game, I created a level dictionary
						which would store all of the informtation that the game loop needed in order to
						run a new level, which made it simple to balance and modify different sections of
						the game.
					</p>
					<div class="align-center">

					</div>
					<p style="padding-top:2%">
						Left to right, the data included the player's speed, time range between enemy spawns,
						list of potential enemy spawns, the leve's boss, the amount of distance from the
						player's starting location to the boss, and the level's timer. These were all of the 
						variables that we wanted to modify between levels, and storing them in this way allowed us
						to both add and scale the difficulty of levels on the fly. 
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Looking back on my code, there are certainly many improvements that could be made.
						For instance, though the code for drawing enemies could easily have been implemented in
						the base enemy class, I ended up creating separate functions for each enemy type.
						Despite the naive implementation of many things, I am quite proud of how this project
						turned out. I was able to design a concept, create a realistic development timeline, and execute
						on it. I also gained valuable experience on how to collaborate with other programmers and
						utilize version control software, and I learned firsthand how essential it is to
						pre-plan the overarching systems that need to be programmed into the game.
